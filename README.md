## Project Methodology

1.  **Data Preparation:** Loaded and merged six `.xlsx` files using Python (pandas) into a master dataset of **7,043 unique customers**. Cleaned data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
2.  **Exploratory & Diagnostic Analysis:** Visualized the data to understand *why* and *when* customers leave.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Built a Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-learn) with **93% accuracy** to identify at-risk customers.
4.  **Prescriptive Recommendations:** Developed a strategic action plan based on the key findings.

## Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1\. Contract Flexibility is the Biggest Risk Factor

Customers on **Month-to-Month contracts** are far more likely to churn than those on long-term contracts.

### 2\. New Customers are Most Likely to Leave

Churn is highest among customers with low tenure. Loyalty increases significantly over time.

### 3\. Senior Citizens are a High-Risk Demographic

The churn rate spikes for customers aged 65 and older, making them a key group for retention efforts.

## Recommendations

  * **Incentivize Long-Term Contracts:** Proactively offer deals to month-to-month customers to switch to yearly plans.
  * **Launch a Loyalty Program:** Reward new customers for milestones in their first year.
  * **Develop a Competitive Retention Strategy:** Empower support teams to match competitor offers for high-value, at-risk customers.
